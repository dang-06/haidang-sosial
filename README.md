## Get Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps to set up both the frontend and backend.

### 1. Setup Backend
1. **Install backend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the development server for the backend, typically running on `http://localhost:${PORT}`.
### 2. Setup Frontend
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. **Start the frontend development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the development server for the frontend, typically running on `http://localhost:5173`.
### 3. Build for Production
To create a production build of the frontend application, follow these steps:
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. **Build the frontend for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a production build of the frontend application in the `frontend/dist` directory.
   
### Additional Setup
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have a `.env` file with the required environment variables.
By following these steps, you will have both the frontend and backend servers running and be able to interact with your full-stack application.
